# Li Shizhen 

_Li Shizhen_ (1518-1593) was born in Qizhou, Hunguang. His family had practiced medicine for the past two generations. In 1531, he passed the first level of examinations, but failed three times in a row to pass the second level. Giving up hope, he became a skilled healer with a reputation and served the Prince of Chu, a local branch of the imperial family.[^1]

## Ming Dynasty China
The _Ming dynasty_ (/mɪŋ/), officially the Great Ming, was the ruling dynasty of China from 1368 to 1644 following the collapse of the Mongol-led Yuan dynasty. The Ming dynasty was the last imperial dynasty of China ruled by Han Chinese. Although the primary capital of Beijing fell in 1644 to a rebellion led by Li Zicheng (who established the Shun dynasty, soon replaced by the Manchu-led Qing dynasty), numerous rump regimes ruled by remnants of the Ming imperial family—collectively called the Southern Ming—survived until 1662.

# Li Shizhen 

## Image

_Li Shizhen_ (1518-1593) was born in Qizhou, Hunguang. His family had practiced medicine for the past two generations. In 1531, he passed the first level of examinations, but failed three times in a row to pass the second level. Giving up hope, he became a skilled healer with a reputation and served the Prince of Chu, a local branch of the imperial family.[^1]

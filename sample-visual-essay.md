# Li Shizhen

In 1531, he passed the first level of examinations, but failed three times in a row to pass the second level. He decided to persue the same path as his father, Li Yanwen or Li Yuechi, to work as a physician and medical practitioner. He became a skilled healer with a reputation and served the Prince of Chu, a local branch of the imperial family. [^1] Eventually, he moved bak home and began to focus on investigating, verifying, and refuting prior medicinal knowledge. He studied collections, which he had access to becuase of his time serving in the Imperial Medical Academy, and gathered information from locals, including oeasants, fishermen, travelers, farmers, hunters, and craftsmen.

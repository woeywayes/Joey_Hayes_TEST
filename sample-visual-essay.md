# Li Shizhen 

_Li Shizhen_ (1518-1593) was born in Qizhou, Hunguang. His family had practiced medicine for the past two generations. In 1531, he passed the first level of examinations, but failed three times in a row to pass the second level. He decided to persue the same path as his father, Li Yanwen or Li Yuechi, to work as a physician and medical practitioner. He became a skilled healer with a reputation and served the Prince of Chu, a local branch of the imperial family. [^1] Eventually, he moved bak home and began to focus on investigating, verifying, and refuting prior medicinal knowledge. He studied collections, which he had access to becuase of his time serving in the Imperial Medical Academy, and gathered information from locals, including oeasants, fishermen, travelers, farmers, hunters, and craftsmen.

_Bencao Gangmu_ (English: Compendium of  Materia Medica) is a phamacopeia of Chinese medicinal knowledge, written by Li during the Ming Dynasty. [^2]  Li's bencao took over 30 years to write and was published in 1596, three years after his death. The pharmacopeia contains 1,892 entries: 1,094 botanicals, 444 zoolgical items, 275 minerals, and 79 miscellaneous items. [^1]  The pharmacopeia also includes international materials brought to China via European trade, including grapes, carrots, pumpkins, yams, Panax pseudo-ginseng, yasmin, tulips, and camphor. [^1]
